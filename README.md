## **👉 ABOUT**
OSINTYR is a tool that helps OSINT investigators and cybersecurity researchers to leverage the full power of Google dorking for their investigations. Google dorking is a technique that uses advanced search operators to uncover hidden information and vulnerabilities in websites and web applications. However, crafting effective dork queries requires creativity, knowledge, and experience.

👉 The tool relies only and only on open source intelligence and information indexed by the Google search engine

👉 The tools can only be used for educational purposes, therfore any all liability and responsability from the usage of this tool is on the user itself. 

👉 OSINTYR takes the hassle out of dork query creation by providing a curated collection of out-of-the-box queries that are designed to uncover hard-to-find information and vulnerabilities. The dork queries are carefully crafted and are continuously updated to keep up with the latest trends and threats in mind.

👉 The tool is designed to be easy to use, even for beginners, and provides detailed search results that can be filtered and sorted by various criteria.

👉 This is not the final version, I am looking into adding more cool things for this in the future when thre's time.

👉 Feedback/ideas is welcomed!
