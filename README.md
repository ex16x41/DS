OSINTYR is a tool that helps OSINT investigators and cybersecurity researchers to leverage the full power of Google dorking for their investigations. Google dorking is a technique that uses advanced search operators to uncover hidden information and vulnerabilities in websites and web applications. However, crafting effective dork queries requires creativity, knowledge, and experience.

Tyr Searcher takes the hassle out of dork query creation by providing a curated collection of out-of-the-box queries that are designed to uncover hard-to-find information and vulnerabilities. Our dork queries are carefully crafted by experienced security researchers and are continuously updated to keep up with the latest trends and threats.

The tool is designed to be easy to use, even for beginners, and provides detailed search results that can be filtered and sorted by various criteria.

Tyr Searcher is an open-source project hosted on GitHub. Contributions and feedback from the community is welcomed to make the tool even better. Give it a try and see how it can enhance your OSINT investigations and cybersecurity research.
